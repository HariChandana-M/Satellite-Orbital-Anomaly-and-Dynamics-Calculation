# Satellite-Orbital-Anomaly-and-Dynamics-Calculation
This project models the orbital dynamics of a satellite around Earth using Kepler's equations and Newton-Raphson numerical methods. It computes key orbital parameters, such as the mean, eccentric, and true anomalies, as well as satellite distance and velocity at a specific orbital position. Leveraging gravitational constants and orbital characteristics, the code provides insights into satellite motion based on Keplerian mechanics. Key features include iterative anomaly determination and efficient orbit parameter computation, demonstrating practical applications in celestial mechanics and spaceflight dynamics.
